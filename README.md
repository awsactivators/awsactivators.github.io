[About Me](index.markdown) | [Projects](projects.markdown) | [Contact Me](contact.markdown)

<br>

This repository contains my personal portfolio and resume built using **Markdown** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills, experience, and projects as a **DevOps Engineer** in a clean and simple format, while utilizing Markdown for easy updates and content management.

<br>

## Project Overview

The portfolio consists of three main Markdown files:

- **index.markdown**: This serves as the "About Me" page, providing a summary of my professional experience, skills, education, and certifications.
- **projects.markdown**: This page highlights the projects I've worked on as a DevOps Engineer, detailing the high-level overview, my contributions, and the tools and technologies used.
- **contact.markdown**: This page provides different ways to get in touch with me, including links to my email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.

All three pages are interconnected, creating a seamless experience for anyone viewing the portfolio. The background header image for the pages were gotten from google and are hosted on **Cloudinary**, ensuring fast and reliable access through the embedded link.

## Features

- **Simple and Easy to Update**: Since the portfolio is built entirely with Markdown, it's easy to update content without dealing with complex HTML or CSS.
- **Hosted on GitHub Pages**: The portfolio is live and accessible via GitHub Pages, offering free hosting and easy deployment.
